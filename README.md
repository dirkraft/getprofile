# getprofile

Synchronize user home files between machines.

<img src="https://travis-ci.org/dirkraft/getprofile.svg?branch=master">

In summary this is small wrapper around git for the specific purpose
of synchronizing select user home profile files across many machines.

Example: I regularly use ArchLinux in a VM, OSX, and Cygwin.
I have `~/.bash_prompt` that I would like to be the same
on all my environments. Once configured (explained in detail below)
I follow any changes to `~/.bash_prompt` with

    getprofile push

Then the next time I get on any other machine

    getprofile pull

It is called getprofile because I originally wanted to synchronize
.bash_profile between machines. I think of that and all sourced scripts
as my *profile files*. Now I don't actually sync `.bash_profile` itself,
but rather that includes other sourced files. See
[How I use getprofile](#how-i-use-getprofile) for more details.

### Install getprofile

Dev builds: https://github.com/dirkraft/getprofile/releases/tag/dev

For Linux, installation might look like this:

    sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/getprofile -L https://github.com/dirkraft/getprofile/releases/download/dev/getprofile.linux.amd64
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/getprofile

### Configure getprofile

getprofile currently stores tracked files via any git repo that can
be addressed in the form`<user>@<host>:<repo>`,
e.g. `git@github.com:dirkraft/profile`.

Currently, only an SSH-accessible git repos are supported (it doesn't
have to be on GitHub!). If you plan to synchronize files with sensitive
information like keys, be sure that the repository is **private**.

    $ getprofile config --help
    NAME:
       getprofile config - Set up getprofile

    USAGE:
       getprofile config REPOSITORY_URL

    DESCRIPTION:

    Set where the profile repository is located. Supported formats:

        git-compatible names: e.g. git@github.com:user/repo

### Use getprofile

Files must first be tracked for getprofile to care about them.
Note that getprofile only operates on the assumption that tracked files
live within the current user's home directory.

    getprofile add FILE

Then they can be push to the configured repo.

    getprofile push

To overwrite local profile files with the latest from the repo

    getprofile pull

To untrack files without deleting the local copy

    getprofile rm FILE

### What getprofile does not do well

  - Concurrent changes. Conflicting updates will simply overwrite each
    other. If you are working from multiple environments and modifying
    tracked files on each, be careful about the order of `getprofile
    sync`s.

### How I use getprofile

I track .vimrc because I want it identical on all environments without
exception.

I do not track .bashrc or .bash_profile since these aren't consistently
integrated between OSX and different Linux distros. Instead I have the
following tracked by getprofile in my own scripts folder.

    $ tree ~/.dirkraftrc/
    /home/dirkraft/.dirkraftrc/
    ├── source_all.sh
    └── sources
        ├── bash_prompt.sh
        ├── github.sh
        ├── go.sh
        └── ... and so on ...

Here is source_all.sh

    #/usr/bin/env bash

    for f in ~/.dirkraftrc/sources/*; do source $f; done

Then on each machine I add to whatever .bash_* that makes sense

    . ~/.dirkraftrc/source_all.sh

If certain scripts can't be sourced on a machine, I'm still able to
take advantage of `getprofile sync` and selectively source whichever
scripts I like.

### Future ideas

  - Hook into filesystem events and/or periodically check for changes to
    tracked files, and automatically push changes as they occur.
  - Install a login hook to pull updates on user login.
  - Periodically pull updates when the user is idle, and we are
    relatively sure that they are not currently editing any profile
    files.

### Development

Get any dependencies via a make target.

    make develop

To run commands in development, replace `getprofile` with `go run ...`

    go run getprofile.go args...

To build binaries for all targeted platforms

    make clean all

For me to publish new dev releases to
https://github.com/dirkraft/getprofile/releases/tag/dev

    export GITHUB_TOKEN
    make clean publish-dev
